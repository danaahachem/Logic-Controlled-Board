# Logic-Controlled-Board
This project was developed as part of the Logic Design course at LAU Beirut. It focuses on digital logic circuit design using basic logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and other fundamental digital components. The system was designed, simulated, and implemented on hardware as a final course project.
